# Horse Coat Color Calculator — Starter

A ready-to-run Next.js (App Router) app with Tailwind, minimal shadcn-style UI, PWA, and your calculator wired in.

## Quick Start

```bash
# 1) Install deps
npm i

# 2) Dev
npm run dev
# open http://localhost:3000

# 3) Build
npm run build
npm start
```

## Deploy (Vercel)

- Push this folder to a GitHub repo.
- Import the repo at vercel.com → Deploy.

## Notes

- Minimal Button/Card components are included under src/components/ui to avoid needing the shadcn generator.
- PWA is enabled in production builds only; use “Add to Home Screen” on your phone after deploy.
- Your component lives at src/components/HorseColorCalculator.tsx
